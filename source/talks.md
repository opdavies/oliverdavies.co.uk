# Talks

I regularly speak at conferences and user groups about a range of subjects including Drupal, Sculpin and Git. If you would like to me to speak at your group or conference, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Speaking%20enquiry">get in touch</a>.

There is also information about events that Iâ€™ve attended and spoken at on my <a href="{{ site.lanyrd.url }}">Lanyrd</a> and <a href="{{ site.joindin.url }}">Joind.in</a> profiles.
