# Consulting and Development

I am usually available for part-time engagements outside of my day job for {{ site.author.company.name_short }}, providing there is no conflict of interest.

The services that I offer are:

* PHP and front-end development (in particular Drupal, Symfony, Silex and Laravel).
* Static website development with Sculpin or Jekyll.
* Further development, maintenance and refactoring of existing websites.
* Linux server administration and maintenance.

If you have any questions or want to discuss a project, then please [contact me][0].
