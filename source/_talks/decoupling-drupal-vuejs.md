Decoupled or headless Drupal has been a trend for a number of years, with modules like RESTful Web Services available for Drupal 7 to expose data, and Drupal 8 becoming more API-first with JSON:API module now included as part of core. This makes it easier for third party systems or alternative front-end applications to consume and work with the data provided by Drupal.

In this talk, weâ€™ll look at how to build progressively and fully decoupled applications - passing data from a Drupal 8 back-end to a Vue.js front-end.
