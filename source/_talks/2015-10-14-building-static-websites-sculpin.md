title: Building Static Websites with Sculpin
summary: |
    Sculpin is a static site generator written in PHP. It converts Markdown files, Twig templates and standard HTML into a static HTML site that can be easily deployed.

    This talk will cover a little of the background to Sculpin and what it is, and then will move into some demonstrations of how to build a Sculpin site and what it can do!
