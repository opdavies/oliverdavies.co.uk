The points to cover were:

* How does your CMS store configuration data, 'structure' and content?
* How do you manage source-control, versioning and deployment?
* How do you manage multiple simultaneous editors and/or developers?
* How do you manage upgrades?
* What are the 3 best things about your CMS?
* What are the 3 worst things about your CMS?
* What does the future of your CMS look like?

In each point, tried to cover the differences between Drupal core and developing a project using Drupal, as well as between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8, as things like source control and versioning would be approached differently.

Presented at the [umBristol user group](http://umbristol.co.uk) in August 2015.
