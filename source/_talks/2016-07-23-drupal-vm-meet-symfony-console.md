After an introduction to Drupal VM itself and the Drupal VM Generator, weâ€™ll jump into the code and see how Symfony Console applications are structured, how to write new commands, and how to integrate additional libraries like Guzzle, Twig and other Symfony components - whilst referencing code from the Drupal VM Generator project.

Presented at [DrupalCamp Bristol 2016](https://2016.drupalcampbristol.co.uk).
