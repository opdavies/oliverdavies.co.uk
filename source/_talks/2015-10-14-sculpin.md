[Sculpin](http://sculpin.io) is a static site generator written in PHP. It converts Markdown files, Twig templates and standard HTML into a static HTML site that can be easily deployed.

This talk will cover a little of the background to Sculpin and what it is, and then will move into some demonstrations of how to build a Sculpin site and what it can do!

The full version of the slides are available at <https://opdavies.github.io/phpsw-sculpin>, including the embedded videos.
