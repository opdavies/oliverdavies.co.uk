title: Having Fun with Drupal 8, PHP libraries and the Drupal.org API
summary: |
    A demo of some of the open source projects that Iâ€™ve been working on lately
    that are based on information from the Drupal.org API, including a PHP library
    for the API itself as well as some Drupal 8 modules that use it.
