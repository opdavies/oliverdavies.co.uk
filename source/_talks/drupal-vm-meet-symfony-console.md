_TL;DR - Come and learn about Symfony Console, with examples from a real-world project._

The [Drupal VM Generator][2] is a CLI application, built on [Symfony Console][0], that generates configuration files for [Drupal VM][1] based on personal settings and user interaction.

After an introduction to Drupal VM itself and the Drupal VM Generator, weâ€™ll jump into the code and see how Symfony Console applications are structured, how to write new commands, and how to integrate additional libraries like Guzzle, Twig and other Symfony components - whilst referencing code from the Drupal VM Generator project.
