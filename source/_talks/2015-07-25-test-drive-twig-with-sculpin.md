This session covers how to download and install Sculpin on your computer, and how to build a Sculpin site using YAML,
Markdown and Twig which you can use as a stand-alone static website or as a HTML prototype that you can copy and paste
into your Drupal 8 theme.

We'll also cover tips and tricks such as Sculpin themes, layouts and partials, and common Twig methods such as blocks
and template inheritance, loops, conditional statements and filters.
