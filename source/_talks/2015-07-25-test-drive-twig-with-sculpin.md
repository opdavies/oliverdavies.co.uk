This session covers how to install Sculpin itself, as well as how to use it to build a static site from Markdown, HTML and Twig templates. We also covered Sculpin concepts such as content types, themes and partials, and Twig layouts, blocks and inheritance, as well as some tips and tricks that I've found whilst developing with Sculpin.
