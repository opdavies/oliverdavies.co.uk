In this session, we’ll cover:

* Where Drupal 8 modules are located, and how they are structured.
* How to build a simple module, including our own permissions and routes.
* How to add your own controller and service classes.
* What is the service/dependency injection container, and how do we use it?
* How we can use tools such as PhpStorm and Drupal Console to speed up the process.

What we won’t be covering:

* Automated testing in PHPUnit or Simpletest.
* Adding third party libraries and external dependencies via Composer.
