<h1>Talks</h1>

<p>I regularly speak at conferences and user groups about a range of subjects including Drupal, Sculpin and Git. If you would like to me to speak at your group or conference, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>There is also information about events that Iâ€™ve attended and spoken at on my <a href="{{ site.lanyrd.url }}">Lanyrd</a> and <a href="{{ site.joindin.url }}">Joind.in</a> profiles.</p>
