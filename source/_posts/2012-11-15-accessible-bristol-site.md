I'm happy to announce that the [Accessible Bristol](http://www.accessiblebristol.org.uk) website was launched this week, on Drupal 7.

The site has been developed over the past few months, and uses the [User Relationships](http://drupal.org/project/user_relationships) and [Privatemsg](http://drupal.org/project/privatemsg) modules to provide a community-based platform where people with an interest in accessibility can register and network with each other.
