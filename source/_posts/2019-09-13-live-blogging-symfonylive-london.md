Inspired by [Matt Stauffer](https://twitter.com/stauffermatt)'s [live blogging of the keynote](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/introducing-laravel-vapor) at Laracon US, I’m going to do the same for the sessions that I’m attending at [SymfonyLive London 2019](https://london2019.live.symfony.com)...

## Keynote (Back to the basics)

**Embrace the Linux philosophy**

How we grow the Symfony ecosystem. Built abstracts.
HttpFoundation, HttpKernel
Moved to infrastructure
A few abstractions on top of PHP. Improved versions of PHP functions (`dump`)
Started a add higher level abstractions (e.g. Mailer), built on the lower ones.
