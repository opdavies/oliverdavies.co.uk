Inspired by [Matt Stauffer](https://twitter.com/stauffermatt)'s [live blogging of the keynote](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/introducing-laravel-vapor) at Laracon US, I’m going to do the same for the sessions that I’m attending at [SymfonyLive London 2019](https://london2019.live.symfony.com)...

## Keynote (Back to the basics)

**Embrace the Linux philosophy**

* How we grow the Symfony ecosystem. Built abstracts.
* HttpFoundation, HttpKernel
* Moved to infrastructure
* A few abstractions on top of PHP. Improved versions of PHP functions (`dump`)
* Started a add higher level abstractions (e.g. Mailer), built on the lower ones.
* Recently worked on PHPUnit assertions. Mailer in Symony 4.4. Can test if an email is sent or queued

Building flexible high-level abstractions on top of low-level ones

### What's next?

* Mailer announced in London last year. New component.
* System emails?
*
