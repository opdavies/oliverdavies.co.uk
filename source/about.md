My name is Oliver Davies (aka [opdavies][1]) - a Full Stack Web Developer and System Administrator based in Wales, UK. I’m a {{ site.work.role }} at [{{ site.companies[site.work.company].name }}][20], part-time freelancer, former Developer at the [{{ site.companies.drupal_association.name }}][39], open source contributor and advocate, mentor and conference speaker.

I primarily work with Drupal and am an [Acquia certified Drupal Grand Master][41], but also use Symfony, Laravel and Sculpin, and have some experience working with JavaScript frameworks including Vue.js and Angular.

I’m a webmaster and documentation maintainer for [Drupal.org][42], and a provisional member of the [Drupal Security team][14]. [I speak at various user groups and conferences][40], and co-organise the [Drupal Bristol user group][15], [PHPSW][17] and [DrupalCamp Bristol][18].

You can find me on [Twitter][21], and see my open source work on [Drupal.org][22] and [GitHub][23] as well as on [Packagist][24], [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~opdavies) and [Ansible Galaxy][25].
