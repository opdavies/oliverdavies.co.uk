[drupalvmgenerator.com][1] is a Drupal 8 website for the Drupal VM Generator project.

It contains information about the project such as installation instructions, but also integrates with GitHub to provide a download link to the latest drupalvm.phar file, and provides a manifest file for the `self:update` command to use.

Iâ€™ve also started adding [articles][2] onto the site to coincide with new releases and announcements.
