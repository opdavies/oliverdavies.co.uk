# About

<img src="{{ site.gravatar.url }}?s=125" alt="Picture of Oliver" class="img-circle">

I’m a Web Developer and System Administrator based in Newport, South Wales, UK.

I’m currently a Senior Developer at [Microserve](https://microserve.io), and a part-time freelancer. I specialise in PHP development with <a href="{{ site.drupalorg.url_nice }}">Drupal</a> and [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io/), and Linux server administration. I’m also currently learning [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) and [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/).

I’m a Drupal core contributor and <a href="{{ site.drupalorg.url }}/people-mentored">mentor</a>, and a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/user/{{ site.drupalorg.uid }}">contrib project maintainer</a>. I’m also the Drupal [Git documentation maintainer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2248627#comment-8887789) and provisional member of the [Drupal Security Team](https://www.drupal.org/security-team).

I also contribute to other open-source projects including [Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com) (a Vagrant and Ansible based virtual environment for Drupal development), [COD](http://usecod.io) (the conference organising distribution, built on Drupal), and various Puppet modules and Ansible roles.

I’m a user group and conference organiser and [speaker](/talks/), and a founding committee member of [DrupalCamp Bristol](http://www.drupalcampbristol.co.uk).

You can follow me on <a href="{{ site.twitter.url }}">Twitter</a> and <a href="{{ site.linkedin.url }}">LinkedIn</a>, and you can view my code on <a href="{{ site.drupalorg.url }}/track/code">Drupal.org</a> and <a href="{{ site.github.url }}?tab=activity">GitHub</a>.
