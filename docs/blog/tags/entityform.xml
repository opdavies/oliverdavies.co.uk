        <description><p>I recently had my first experience using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/entityform">Entityform module</a> in a project. It was quite easy to configure with different form types, but then I needed to embed the form into an overlay. I was expecting to use the <code>drupal_get_form()</code> function and render it, but this didnâ€™t work.</p>

<p>Here are the steps that I took to be able to load, render and embed the form.</p>
