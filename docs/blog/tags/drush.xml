        <description><p>If you use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features module</a> to manage your Drupal configuration, it can be time consuming to update features through the UI, especially if you are working on a remote server and need to keep downloading and uploading files.</p>

<p>If you re-create a feature through the UI, you'll be prompted to download a new archive of the feature in its entirety onto your local computer. You could either commit this into a local repository and then pull it remotely, or use a tool such as SCP to upload the archive onto the server and commit it from there. You can simplify this process by using <a href="http://drush.org">Drush</a>.</p>

        <description><p>If you use <a href="https://raw.github.com/drush-ops/drush/master/README.md" title="About Drush">Drush</a>, it's likely that you've used the <code>drush pm-download</code> (or <code>drush dl</code> for short) command to start a new project. This command downloads projects from Drupal.org, but if you don't specify a project or type "drush dl drupal", the command will download the current stable version of Drupal core. Currently, this will be Drupal 7 with that being the current stable version of core at the time of writing this post.</p>

<p>But what if you don't want Drupal 7?</p>

        <description><p>There are times when doing Drupal development when you need to run a custom PHP script, maybe moving data from one field to another, that doesn't warrant the time and effort to create a custom module. In this scenario, it would be quicker to write a .php script and bootstrap Drupal to gain access to functions like <code>node_load()</code> and <code>db_query()</code>.</p>

<p>To bootstrap Drupal, you would need to add some additional lines of code to the stop of your script. Here is an alternative way.</p>
