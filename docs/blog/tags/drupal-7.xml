        <title>Turning Your Custom Drupal Module into a Feature</title>

        <description><p>Yesterday I was fixing a bug in an inherited Drupal 7 custom module, and I decided that I was going to add some tests to ensure that the bug was fixed and doesn’t get accidentially re-introduced in the future. The test though required me to have a particular content type and fields which are specific to this site, so weren’t present within the standard installation profile used to run tests.</p>

<p>I decided to convert the custom module into a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/features">Feature</a> so that the content type and it’s fields could be added to it, and therefore present on the testing site once the module is installed.</p>

<p>To do this, I needed to expose the module to the Features API.</p>

        <description><p>I recently had my first experience using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/entityform">Entityform module</a> in a project. It was quite easy to configure with different form types, but then I needed to embed the form into an overlay. I was expecting to use the <code>drupal_get_form()</code> function and render it, but this didn’t work.</p>

<p>Here are the steps that I took to be able to load, render and embed the form.</p>

        <description><p>I've recently started using <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a> rather than LESS to do my CSS preprocessing - namely due to its integration with <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> and it's built-in CSS3 mixins. Here are three modules that provide the ability to use SASS within Drupal.</p>
