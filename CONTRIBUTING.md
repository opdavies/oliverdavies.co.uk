2. Create an appropriately-named branch for the change or addition that you want to make.
3. Commit your changes to your branch.
4. [Create a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) against the original `master` base branch.

If the pull request is approved, the code will be merged into the `master` branch and deployed to http://www.oliverdavies.uk.
